This repository contains code for training a RandomForestClassifier model using scikit-learn, specifically focusing on multi-output classification tasks with the MultiOutputClassifier wrapper. The goal is to predict whether individuals receive two different vaccines (xyz_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine) based on various demographic and health-related features.
